**Our mission is to provide information for the sound use of Montana's geological and water resources.**

**Our vision is to be Montana's lead source of geologic and water information.**

As a non-regulatory State agency within the Montana University System, we serve as Montana's geologic survey, addressing topics ranging from earthquake monitoring and geologic mapping to energy development and groundwater. We are housed on the campus of Montana Technological University and maintain a fully staffed office in Billings, MT.
